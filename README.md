GITCOIN-GRANTS-ROUND-14-HACKATHON

Refi summer design

I have always been incredibly passionate about Science fiction and humanity's struggle with climate change and solar punk have been my answer to those two passions. 
Working on this grant have been incredibly fun as i get to explore all those things in my own artstyle. 
Here we can see a solar farmer robot getting lies and appreciation for doing good work tending to his solar farm. 
There are some inspirations from 80s retro aesthetics mixed with my own style of mech design to give a fusion of nature and technology growing together sustainably

**Gitcoin grant**

here is my design for the gitcoin grant, its inspired by our optimist future and solar punk motifs and a cute robot recieving appreciation
and likes for the work he is doing tending to his solar farm and sustainably growing.
